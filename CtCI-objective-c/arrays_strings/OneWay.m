 There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.
 EXAMPLE
 pale, ple -> true pales, pale -> true pale, bale -> true pale, bake -> false
