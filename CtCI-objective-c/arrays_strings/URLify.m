/*
 Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20  You may assume that the string has suf cient space at the end to hold the additional characters,and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java,please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)
 EXAMPLE
 Input: "Mr John Smith ", 13 Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
